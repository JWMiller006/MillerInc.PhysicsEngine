## About 
This library aims to represent the physical interaction between objects in a scalable manner. This should include everything from general objects down to atomic charges. Being that this is a large undertaking, this project will be in constant development and may be a while before it becomes usable. 

The goal is to make this library usable on many platforms by using C# and C++ libraries and optimizing the computation through different processors and allowing the user to decide to use either the GPU or CPU. Though the CPU side will be developed first. 

## Legal 
This software, since it aims to be multi-platform based, the algorithms will be built from ground up (unless otherwise specified within the source code)
